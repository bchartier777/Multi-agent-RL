# Modified implementation of MADDPG
This is a modified implementation of Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG).  [This](https://github.com/Lizhi-sjtu/MARL-code-pytorch/tree/main) is the reference repo, developed by Lizhi Sjtu.  This is a well written implementation of multiple MARL algorithms.<br/>

## Summary of changes
The primary purpose of this implementation was to evaluate the benefit of the following changes to average return:
 - Added second Actor/Critic network, Actor_v2, Critic_v2, implemeting additional stacked linear layers with an optional BatchNorm1d (BatchNorm1d is not yet working).  Also implements user-defined fc1 and fc2 unit size
 - Added third recurrent Actor/Critic network, Actor_v3 and Critic_v3, implementing an LSTM.  The algorithm is executing but the return does not converge since additional modifications are required to the replay buffer and Q calculations.
 - Added an optional Gumbel softmax to the action. This only works with the original Actor / Critic_MADDPG networks.
 - Added optional noise from an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, in addition to the Gaussian noise.
 - Added an optional execution of user-defined number of random samples from the action space prior to choosing actions from the network
 - Enabled AdamW optimizer
 - Minor changes to enable execution of additional MPE scenarios as well as limited refactoring to enable diagnostics

## Testing environments
The version of MNIST downloaded with the TorchVision Dataset object.  The return has been validated on simple_speaker_listener.  Tested for execution but not averge return on simple_tag, simple_spread, simple_push, simple_crypto and simple_adversary.  Not yet working on simple_world_comm, simple_reference and simple.

## Performance
The return for the simple_speaker_listener environment is similar to the reference repo.  One next step is to quantify performance on the other Petting Zoo environments.

## Environment requirements
Requires [this](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs) version of Multi-agent Particle Environment (MPE).  See the notes in the original repo in the reference section for the minor changes which are required to make_env.py and environment.py in MPE to enable support for discrete environments.

## Python version and Conda environment
This has been tested with Python 3.7.9 on Win 10.  Use of a virtual environment is recommended.  Following is a Conda implementation:

```
conda create --name marl_env python==3.7.9 pip
conda activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements.txt file was generated with pipreqs, not the environment configuration from the reference repo, but should be correct.

## Usage
All execution parameters are implemented in parse_args in utils.py.  Following is an example for the simple speaker listener environment.

```
python MADDPG_MATD3_main.py --env_name simple_speaker_listener  1>ExecOut\stdOutMADDPG_SimpSpeak.txt  2>ExecOut\stdErrMADDPG_SimpSpeak.txt```
```

## Outputs
The return at each timestep is output to the terminal.  Have not yet integrated Tensorboard or average return graph generation.

## Results
Executing with Actor_v2, Critic_v2, the average returns for simple speaker listener are similar to  Actor_v1 / Critic_v1.  One of the next steps is to quantify return with other enhancements enabled.

## Next steps
 - Scope integration of Multi-agent Mujoco [REF]- May require Linux, my current dev environment is Window
 - Quantify performance of subset of combination of new options with multiple Petting Zoo environments
 - Scope completion of the recurrent Actor and Critic classes, requires mods to the two primary training methods
